								<h3>Emergency Chest Pain Check-u</h3>
								<p>Our Emergency Chest Pain Check-ups benefit anyone suffering from acute chest pain. Many patients would have some concerns over a hospital stay and may not present themselves at a hospital to be thoroughly examined to eliminate a cardiac cause for a sudden onset of a  chest pain.
								
								With this in mind, Medicom Hospital offers two check-ups for outpatients with facilities on hand for investigations to determine and exclude heart attacks or conditions which may lead to heart attacks. It is not necessary to reserve appointments for these check-ups as they are for emergency cases requiring immediate attention. These check-ups are convenient, affordable and bring assurance to our patients. </p>
